### Multi-View Summarization and Activity Recognition Meet Edge Computing in IoT Environments

## Paper
Openreview [submitted to ICLR]: https://openreview.net/forum?id=HJgHUCNFPS

Accepted in IEEE Internet of Things Journal: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9208765

## Demo Video

## Notice
Prior to the codes usage for industrial purposes or re-distribution, please read the licensing information given at the end of  <b> README file </b>



## How to Run? 
Please refer to the supplementory file pdf for details and instructions are given in each folder with "Readme.txt" file relevant to each folder. 

The activity recognition code has been implemented in MATLAB 2018a and the results indicated in the paper are based on those experiments, while the Python codes in Activity Recognition folder are used to run over resource-constrained device (Raspberry-Pi).

Since video files are not playable, so I've uploaded them over Google drive, you can refer to this link:

The Summarization and Activity Recognition results are separate and attached with their corresponding folders.
